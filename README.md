**Hi, I'm Anshuman Rana** – founder of Logiquel, a SaaS-based platform I built to help individuals and businesses grow their online presence, streamline operations, and ship production-ready web & mobile apps faster. **I also provide app development for Android (using Kotlin/Java) as well as iOS apps** – creating native experiences with smooth UI/UX, push notifications, offline capabilities, and seamless API integrations, or cross-platform solutions with Kotlin Multiplatform for faster delivery across both platforms.

This repository contains the source code for Logiquel – my full-stack web application with backend services, frontend UI, and modern tooling integrations.

From scalable REST APIs in **Spring Boot** and **Node.js** to clean, responsive interfaces in **React** and **Next.js**, I focus on reliability, performance, and exceptional developer experience.
